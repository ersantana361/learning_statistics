# StatLab: Interactive Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

## Vision

A hands-on learning environment where abstract statistical concepts become tangible through interactive visualizations and real-world scenarios. Instead of memorizing formulas, you'll build intuition by experimenting with data, watching distributions come alive, and making decisions like a practicing data scientist.

## Why This Project?

Statistics is often taught as a collection of formulas and procedures. But real statistical thinking is about understanding uncertainty, making informed decisions with incomplete information, and knowing when your conclusions are trustworthy. This project bridges the gap between textbook knowledge and practical application.

## Learning Journey

### Module 1: Foundations of Uncertainty

Build intuition for randomness and probability before diving into formal methods.

- Visualize how sample means behave differently from individual observations
- Watch the Central Limit Theorem emerge through simulation
- Develop gut feelings for what "statistically unusual" actually looks like
- Explore the relationship between sample size and reliability

### Module 2: The Logic of Hypothesis Testing

Understand the reasoning framework before applying specific tests.

- Frame real questions as statistical hypotheses
- Grasp the adversarial nature of null hypothesis testing
- Visualize what p-values actually represent (and what they don't)
- Experience Type I and Type II errors through interactive scenarios
- Build intuition for statistical power and effect sizes

### Module 3: Comparing Groups

Apply hypothesis testing to the most common real-world question: "Are these different?"

- Two-sample comparisons with visual effect size exploration
- Paired vs. independent designs and when each matters
- The assumption game: what happens when assumptions break
- From significance to practical importance

### Module 4: Relationships and Patterns

Move beyond "different or not" to understanding how variables relate.

- Correlation: strength, direction, and the danger of causation claims
- Simple regression as prediction and explanation
- Residuals as diagnostic storytelling
- Multiple predictors and the challenge of interpretation

### Module 5: Beyond the Basics

Encounter the messy realities of applied statistics.

- What to do when normality fails: robust alternatives
- Multiple testing and the replication crisis
- Bayesian thinking as a different lens
- Choosing the right test: a decision framework

## Interactive Features

### The Sandbox

A playground for experimentation where you can generate data, manipulate parameters, and immediately see consequences. Change a sample size and watch confidence intervals shrink. Add outliers and see how different tests respond.

### Scenario Challenges

Work through realistic situations: A/B tests for a product team, clinical trial analysis, survey data interpretation. Make decisions and get feedback on your statistical reasoning, not just your final answer.

### Visual Explainers

Every concept paired with dynamic visualizations. Drag sliders to see distributions shift. Click through step-by-step test procedures. Overlay theoretical curves on simulated data.

### The Misconception Museum

A dedicated space addressing the most common statistical misunderstandings. Interactive demonstrations showing why "p < 0.05 means the result is true" and similar beliefs lead you astray.

## What You'll Be Able To Do

By the end of this learning journey, you will:

- Read a research paper's methods section and critically evaluate the statistical choices
- Design appropriate analyses for your own questions
- Explain statistical concepts to non-technical colleagues without resorting to jargon
- Recognize when standard methods are inappropriate and know alternatives
- Interpret results with appropriate confidence and humility
- Spot common statistical errors in media reports and business presentations

---

## Philosophy

**Learning by doing**: Every concept is accompanied by interactive exercises, not just reading.

**Intuition before formulas**: Understand *why* before *how*.

**Honest about limitations**: Statistics is powerful but not magic. You'll learn what these tools can't tell you.

**Connected to reality**: Examples drawn from domains like product analytics, scientific research, and everyday decision-making.

## Success Metrics

You'll know this project has succeeded when you:

- Feel comfortable, not anxious, when encountering statistical claims
- Naturally ask "how big is the effect?" not just "is it significant?"
- Can sketch what a sampling distribution looks like without running code
- Trust your intuition about whether a result seems reasonable
- Enjoy exploring data rather than dreading the analysis phase
